# Recipes

HTML project to display an assortment of recipes.

## What I used

1. HTML
2. GIT

## Key Points taken from project

1. .md files have their own structure and syntax to be edited nicely.
2. How to properly commit messages, specifically that one can commit messages with a title and a body. I did not know that, I thought commits only had a room for one short line of text.
